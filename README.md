This project is aimed to automate hacking by any medium which can read and write (sceptical about cds). Currently for Windows, different platforms coming soon.
Special Thanks to Nir Sofer and the creator of LaZagne.
Basically, I plan to keep updating the tools untill github STOPS then I will move somewhere else.
